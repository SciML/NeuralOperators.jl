    DeepONet(branch, trunk, additional)

Constructs a DeepONet from a `branch` and `trunk` architectures. Make sure that both the
nets output should have the same first dimension.

## Arguments

  - `branch`: `Lux` network to be used as branch net.
  - `trunk`: `Lux` network to be used as trunk net.

## Input Output Dimensions

Consider a transient 1D advection problem ∂ₜu + u ⋅ ∇u = 0, with an IC u(x,0) = g(x).
We are given several (b = 200) instances of the IC, discretized at 50 points each, and want
to query the solution for 100 different locations and times [0;1].

That makes the branch input of shape [50 x 200] and the trunk input of shape [2 x 100]. So,
the input for the branch net is 50 and 100 for the trunk net.

## Example

```jldoctest
julia> branch_net = Chain(Dense(64 => 32), Dense(32 => 32), Dense(32 => 16));

julia> trunk_net = Chain(Dense(1 => 8), Dense(8 => 8), Dense(8 => 16));

julia> deeponet = DeepONet(branch_net, trunk_net);

julia> ps, st = Lux.setup(Xoshiro(), deeponet);

julia> u = rand(Float32, 64, 5);

julia> y = rand(Float32, 1, 10);

julia> size(first(deeponet((u, y), ps, st)))
(10, 5)
```

Constructs a DeepONet composed of Dense layers. Make sure the last node of `branch` and
`trunk` are same.

## Keyword arguments:

  - `branch`: Tuple of integers containing the number of nodes in each layer for branch net
  - `trunk`: Tuple of integers containing the number of nodes in each layer for trunk net
  - `branch_activation`: activation function for branch net
  - `trunk_activation`: activation function for trunk net
